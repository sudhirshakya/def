# Basic Data Types

## Integer Data Types

Numbers are stored as integers. Even characters can be stored in an integer variable and treated as integers.

| Data Type  | Size      | Min Value                  | Max Value                 |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------:|--------------------------:|
| char        | 1 byte   | -128                       | 127                       |
| short       | 2 bytes  | -32,768                    | 32,767                    |
| int         | 4 bytes  | -2,147,483,648             | 2,147,483,647             |
| long        | 8 bytes  | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| long long   | 8 bytes  | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |


### Modifiers
Besides the length (range), we can also specify whether the variable can hold negative numbers.

Adding ```signed``` implies the variable can store both positive and negative numbers. The first bit of the number is interpreted as the sign of the number with 1 representing a negative number. This is the default behavior and is not required.

Adding ```unsigned``` implies the variable can only store positive numbers. This is used so that variables can be forced to store only positive numbers. A positive outcome is that the range of variable doubles.

### Assigning Integer variables
```C
   int a = 5;     // assigning a decimal value
   int b = 06;    // assigning an octal value
   int c = 0x7;   // assigning a hexadecimal value
   int d = 'f';   // assiging ASCII value of a character
```

## Floating Point Data Types

Floating point numbers are decimal numbers. Decimal numbers are called floating point numbers because the decimal point can "float" in the number. In an integer, the point is always at the end of the number. Double is called double because numbers in double can have double precision after the decimal point.

- float - 4 bytes
- double - 8 bytes
- long double - 16 bytes

Decimal numbers are normalized and stored.
2.5 would be normalized to 0.25 E1 and stored.

The 4 bytes of the floating point number is divided into
- 1 bit for sign (positive/negative)
- 8 bits for exponents
- 23 bits for mantissa

float - IEEE 754 Single precision floating point number

Maximum value: 3.402823E38

double - IEEE 754 double precision floating point number

## Special Data Type
void

One example we have encountered is when functions return nothing.``` void main ()```



```C
#include <stdio.h>

void main ()
{
	printf ("Int: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (int));
	printf ("Char: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (char));
	printf ("Char: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (unsigned char));
	printf ("Char: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (signed char));
	printf ("Short: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (short));
	printf ("Long: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (long));
	printf ("Long Long: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (long long));
	printf ("float: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (float));
	printf ("double: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (double));
	printf ("long double: %ld bytes\n", sizeof (long double));
}
```
